Housing Removing Problem:

queries = [6,3,7,2,9,1]


def build(houses,queries):
    houses.sort()
    last = houses[-1]
    array = [0 for i in range(last)]
    for i in range(len(houses)):
        array[houses[i]-1] = 1

    list = helper(array, queries)
    return list

def helper(array,queries):
    list = []
    for i in range(len(queries)):
        array[queries[i]-1] = 0
        segments = getSegements(array)
        list.append(segments)
    return list

def getSegements(array):
    flag = False
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] == 1 and flag == False:
            count +=1
            flag = True
        elif array[i] == 1 and flag == True:
            continue
        elif array[i] == 0:
            flag = False
    return count


print(build(houses,queries))



# build(houses,queries)
print(build(houses,queries))
